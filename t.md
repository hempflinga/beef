 A 50% NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT is required to BOOK & SECURE your allocated month and we go by a “first come, first serve” basis. 

Payment methods below:
•	Australian clients can use either PAYPAL or BANK-TO-BANK transfer. 
•	International clients (residing outside of Australia) must use PAYPAL only.

When we at One Tribe are ready to start on your tattoo design process, you will be contacted to finalise the outstanding amount. Once received we will send an email confirming your payment and work will then commence.

 Important Notice: Failure to transfer outstanding amount (final payment) within a one-week period of our email will lead to a cancellation of your tattoo design request, unless you have contacted us prior to re-schedule or make other arrangements).

TATTOO DESIGN DELIVERY & DESIGN MEANINGS

Each design takes approximately 3-5 weeks to complete and may take a little longer for larger or multiple pieces. 

Once complete your design will be scanned and emailed to you, accompanied with a documentation outlining who or what the patterns and motifs represent.

After you get your tattoo and we have seen photos, we will then explain in further detail the DEEPER MEANINGS and STORIES of your tattoo. We have put this system in place to ensure our work and most importantly the sacred patterns once worn by our ancestors are protected and not misused in any way.






CLIENT PROFILE FORM

We ask that you answer the questions in the form thoroughly and to the best of your knowledge. Your answers will enable us to understand more about you and your tattoo design request. This stage requires patience and is the true beauty of the journey as it involves taking your own time out to research, reconnect and understand your Filipino ancestry. 
Please provide as much information as you like and only what you are comfortable with sharing.
Thank you.
