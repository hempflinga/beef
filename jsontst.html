This fun, upbeat workshop focuses on ways to discover characters with your scene partner, rather than creating them on your own. We’ll present strategies for using environment and context to activate and heighten characters and relationships, with a focus on organic scene creation and mutual discovery. We’ll find levels within the characters we create, and use those levels to build sustainable scenes, sequences, and worlds.\n\n--\nJustin Peters and Kelly Buttermore are two of America’s top improv instructors.
